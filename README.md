# Learning Nim

This repo contains odd bits and pieces as I'm trying to learn Nim. The code is probably not well optimized or written in a "Nim" way, but it's a start!

The `tutorial/` folder contains some bits and pieces that I've pulled from various tutorials and played with.

The `maze-solver/` folder contains code for the [Tremaux Algorithm](), used to solve mazes. It's been ported from my previous JavaScript implementation just to start writing some Nim code. As a TODO, I'd like to use Nim's `js` build target to generate a file that draws the maze and its solution on a canvas.

## Running the code

For all of the `.nim` files you see, just run:

```shell
‚ùØ nim c -r [filename].nim
```
